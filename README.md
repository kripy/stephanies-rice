# Boilerplate

Skeleton code for creating Sinatra apps, using a striped down version of HTML5 Boilerplate and includes MongoDB setup.

## Hosting

Heroku. Note that the way the program has been set up follows [The Heroku Way](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack). This may not be the way recommended by Sinatra purists, but it is what it is.
