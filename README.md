# Stephanie's Rice

I couldn't be bothered documenting this one. Sue me.

Thing is I wanted to share the code for [Stephanie's Rice](http://www.stephaniesrice.com/) as it's a good start for:

- A Sinatra based web app.
- Hitting an API, in this case the Google Search API, returning JSON, and parsing the results.
- Storing results in Mongo, using Mongoid.
- If/else logic in Mustache templates.

Enjoy.

## Installation

You're still reading this? Okay...

Firstly, make sure you've [installed Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) as it includes [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) for running Procfile-based applications.

"The Google Custom Search API requires the use of an API key, which you can get from the [Google APIs console](http://code.google.com/apis/console/?api=customsearch)." There's two parts to it: the API key and a cx ID which is the Search engine unique ID.

Then in terminal, clone me:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kripy/stephanies-rice stephanies-rice
$ cd stephanies-rice
```

Now, create an ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project. The file should look like this:

```
SR_KEY=<Google API key>
SR_CX=<Google Search Engine cx ID>
```

Fire it up:

```
$ foreman start
```

Open up a browser at ```http://localhost:5000/```: now you're cooking!
